# Interview Challenges

A list of interview challenges that I have received and documented. These problems were created by outside companies and used as part of the hiring process. Each prompt has been documented including any time limits or specific requests, found in each projects `docs` directory. A getting started README is also included in each project with specifications on how to run it.

Some projects may also include a `roadmap` document describing next steps if the prompt included real world scenarios.
